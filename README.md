## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data to uncover trends and patterns related to accident severity, environmental conditions, and vehicle types. The data is visualized using an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** to assist in identifying high-risk factors and regions for informed decision-making and safety improvements.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key columns:

- **Index**: Unique identifier for each accident record
- **Accident_Severity**: Categorized level of accident severity (e.g., Fatal, Serious, Slight)
- **Accident Date**: Date on which the accident occurred
- **Latitude** / **Longitude**: Geographic coordinates of the accident location
- **Light_Conditions**: Lighting environment at the time (e.g., Daylight, Darkness)
- **District Area**: Administrative or jurisdictional area
- **Number_of_Casualties**: Total number of individuals injured or killed
- **Number_of_Vehicles**: Number of vehicles involved in the accident
- **Road_Surface_Conditions**: Surface conditions during the accident (e.g., Dry, Wet)
- **Road_Type**: Type of road (e.g., Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway)
- **Urban_or_Rural_Area**: Indicates whether the location is urban or rural
- **Weather_Conditions**: Weather status at the time (e.g., Fine, Rain, Fog)
- **Vehicle_Type**: Type(s) of vehicles involved in the accident

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify trends in **accident severity** over time and by location
- Analyze the impact of **weather**, **road surface**, and **light conditions**
- Examine the distribution of **vehicle types** involved in accidents
- Highlight **urban vs. rural** accident patterns
- Map accident hotspots using **geographic data**

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel / Power Query**: Data preprocessing and cleaning
- **Python (optional)**: Additional data manipulation if required

## 📈 Dashboard Features

- Interactive filters for **District**, **Severity**, **Weather**, and **Light Conditions**
- Time-series trends of accident counts
- Heatmaps and geospatial visuals of accident locations
- Summary KPIs: Total Accidents, Vehicles Involved, and Casualties
- Breakdown of **road types** and **accident conditions**
